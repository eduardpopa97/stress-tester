# stress-tester

My dissertation thesis describes the software testing technique known as Stress Testing. The role of Stress
Testing is to determine the maximum load that is tolerated by a certain informatic infrastructure such that
it works in optimal parameters. This application is composed of two modules which integrate Apache
JMeter and K6 technologies. For the frontend component I have used the Angular framework and the
backend server is hosted by a Spring Boot application implemented in Java.
